#BIO-PELLET

Air pollution in India is a significant health and environmental 
concern, exacerbated by the widespread burning of crop 
residue in agricultural fields. This practice contributes to the 
emission of harmful pollutants, leading to poor air quality and 
adverse health effects. The lack of efficient mechanisms for the 
disposal of crop residue further compounds the issue.

To address this problem, we aim to develop a web application that serves as a 
platform for farmers to sell their crop residue directly to bio-pellet plant operators. 
Bio-pellets, a sustainable alternative to traditional fuels, can be produced from 
crop residue and used in various applications, including heating and electricity 
generation.

The web application will facilitate the entire process, from 
connecting farmers with bio-pellet plant operators to managing 
the sale and distribution of bio-pellets in the open market. By 
providing a streamlined and transparent marketplace, the 
application aims to incentivize farmers to adopt sustainable 
practices, reduce crop residue burning, and contribute to a cleaner 
and healthier environment.

Target users for your application would include farmers in 
India who are looking to sell their crop residue, bio-pellet 
plant operators (both government and private), and potential 
buyers in the open market interested in purchasing biopellets. It's important to consider the needs and requirements 
of each user group to ensure the success and usability of 
your platform.
